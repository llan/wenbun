The application will automatically look up and generate the readings (like Pinyin) and meanings for you.</p> <p>After providing your word list, a preview will be shown. Some words may have warnings:</p> <ul class="svelte-zc5yvd"><li class="svelte-zc5yvd"><i class="fa-solid fa-triangle-exclamation svelte-zc5yvd"></i> <b>Unsupported Character(s)</b>: This indicates that one or more characters in the word are not supported by the character writer for stroke practice. These words will be ignored during reviews that involve writing.</li> <li class="svelte-zc5yvd"><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-exclamation svelte-zc5yvd"></i> <b>Not in Dictionary</b>: This means the word could not be found in the default dictionary.</li></ul> <p>For words not found in the default dictionary, you can try enabling the <strong>extended dictionary (CC-CEDICT)</strong>. This may help find more obscure words. Please note that the initial loading of the extended dictionary may take a few moments.</p></div> <h2>Custom Deck Input Format</h2> <p>You can import custom decks from text. There are two supported formats: Simple and Anki Text.</p> <div class="section svelte-zc5yvd"><h3>Simple Format</h3> <p>This is the most basic format. Each line should contain a single word or character.</p> <p>Example:</p> <pre class="svelte-zc5yvd"><code>你好
世界
学习
</code></pre> <p>Empty lines will be ignored.</p></div> <div class="section svelte-zc5yvd"><h3>Anki Text Format</h3> <p>This format is for tab-separated text, which is a common export format from Anki.</p> <p>Each line represents a card, with fields separated by tabs. You will need to specify which column contains the Chinese words or characters you want to study.</p> <p>Lines starting with <code>#</code> are treated as comments and will be ignored.</p> <p>Example:</p> <pre class="svelte-zc5yvd"><code>你好	nǐ hǎo	Hello
学习	xué xí	to study
</code></pre> <p>In the example above, the words are in the first column (column 1).</p> <h4>How to Export from Anki</h4> <p>To get a file in this format from the Anki desktop application's export dialog:</p> <ol class="svelte-zc5yvd"><li class="svelte-zc5yvd">Choose the deck you wish to export.</li> <li class="svelte-zc5yvd">For the <b>'Export format'</b>, select <b>Notes in Plain Text</b>.</li> <li class="svelte-zc5yvd">It is recommended to disable the <b>'Include HTML and media references'</b> and <b>'Include tags'</b> options to get a clean text file.</li> <li class="svelte-zc5yvd">Click the <b>'Export'</b> button and save the file.</li></ol></div></div></div>`,1);function v(t){var e=l(),o=a(e);n(o,{title:"Custom Deck Help"}),r(2),s(t,e)}export{v as component};
