            </li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Fixed an issue where the "Reveal" button would still be visible after a word was completed in a review.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>v0.9.0 (2025-09-01)</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Mark/Reveal Buttons</b>: Added buttons to mark a card as unsuccessful or reveal it during a review.</li>
            <li><b>Stroke Speed</b>: Added an option to control the animation speed for the character writer.</li>
            <li><b>Quick Adjust for Daily Limits</b>: Added a feature to quickly adjust today's card limits directly from the overview page.</li>

            <li><b>UI/UX Improvements</b>:
                <ul>
                    <li>The "Extra Study" section on the overview page is now an accordion to save space.</li>
                    <li>Implemented a new, more compact view for the deck browser.</li>
                    <li>Fixed an issue on iOS where the browser would auto-zoom on input fields.</li>
                    <li>Improved touch interactions for the character writer on mobile.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Bug Fixes</b>:
                <ul>
                    <li>Fixed the "Previously Studied" count display on the overview page.</li>
                    <li>Fixed an issue with the review schedule check logic.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>v0.8.2 (2025-08-27)</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Take the warm-up phase into account when <b>calculating the distribution of the new cards</b>.</li>
            <div class="note">
                The calculation for the new card distribution previously didn't account for warm-up periods, causing new/warm-up cards to be grouped together at the end of a session. This has been fixed to ensure a more even distribution, while still supporting the option to skip the warm-up phase.
            </div>
            <li>Add an option to <b>not grade new/warm-up cards</b>.</li>
            <div class="note">
                When this option is disabled (which it is by default now), the system ensures that new and warm-up cards will be studied again the next day. Internally, this is achieved by automatically grading the <b>last</b> warm-up attempt as 'Fail/Again'.
            </div>
            <li>Fix due interval display.</li>
            <div class="note">
                Previously, the due interval display for failed cards was misleading (e.g., showing '2 days' after a second failure). This was a <b>display issue only</b>; the internal scheduling logic was already correctly set to 1 day. The fix corrects the displayed interval to <b>accurately reflect the scheduling</b>.
            </div>
        </ul>

        <h4>v0.8.1 (2025-08-26)</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Fixed an issue with audio retrieval for Traditional Chinese characters.</li>
            <div class="note">
                This should fix the issue with custom deck uploads that use Traditional Chinese characters.
            </div>
        </ul>

        <h4>v0.8.0 (2025-08-24)</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Custom Deck Upload</b>: Users can now upload their own decks in various formats, including Anki decks. A help page has been added for guidance.</li>
            <li><b>Deck Preview</b>: A new component to preview deck contents has been implemented.</li>
            <li>Improved <b>app navigation</b> with custom history for the back button.</li>
            <li>Added a badge to notify users of new <b>changelogs</b>.</li>
            <li>Updated default <b>stroke grading leniency</b> to 1.5.</li>
            <li>Fixed a bug where new card buttons were not saving progress.</li>
            <li>Behind the scenes:
                <ul>

                    <li>Improved Chinese Traditional character handling.</li>
                    <li>UI style improvements.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>v0.7.0 (2025-08-21)</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Added <b>UI scale</b> setting</li>
            <li>Added <b>auto-resolve</b> strategies for sync conflicts
                <div class="note">
                    These changes might break some saves for now, but it will improve the sync in the future. If any user is experiencing data loss, please contact the developer.
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>Improved <b>UI for smaller screens</b></li>
            <li>Changed default <b>stroke grading leniency</b> to 2.0</li>
            <li>Fixed <b>stroke grading leniency</b> setting not being applied properly</li>
            <li>Updated <b>font</b> for consistency across platforms</li>
            <li>Added <b>privacy policy</b> page</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="note">
            For users who were using the old default stroke grading leniency (1.0), it is advised to change it to 2.0 in the settings.
        </div>

        <h4>v0.6.3 (2025-08-17)</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><b>(Major Fix)</b> Updated <b>Chinese dictionary</b> and <b>HSK decks</b></li>
            <div class="note">
                While the HSK 7 deck is still incomplete, this update is being pushed out to deliver fixes for other decks sooner.<br>
                The previous dictionary's coverage for HSK v3.0 was only 70%.
                If you have already added the HSK v3.0 deck, you may still find a few entries missing due to the removal of deprecated words.
                An automatic fix for this issue will be included in a future update.
            </div>
            <li>Added an option to start reviews with the <b>back of the card showing first</b></li>
            <li>Added a <b>health-check page</b> for debugging</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="note">
            It is advised for users to click "reset to default settings" in the settings. Or, if setting to auto grading mode, it's advised to disable short-term scheduling in FSRS settings.
